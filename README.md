# soccer-scrape-and-eval
This repository includes files to scrape the 2018 Men's FIFA World Cup data and an analysis of player time on the field.

## To scrape the site
First run the match_ids.py file; this will extract all match ids for the tournament and outputs a .csv file (match_pages.csv).
Next run the match_player_stats.py file; this will extract the time statistics for each player for each match in the event and outputs a .csv file (world_cup_player_stats.csv).

## Analysis notebook
EDA of time spent on the field by each player who participated in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
